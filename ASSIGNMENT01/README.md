## Redesigning the SCCWRP's Website

The Southern California Coastal Water Research Project (SCCWRP) is responsible for researching marine waters and setting guidelines for the state. With such an important responsibility, it is integral they communicate and organize their research effectively. However, upon reviewing their website, I believe their site could improve to better share their findings with the public along with the institutions using their guidelines. With my UX design, I hope to improve their site's overall layout, facilitate navigation for users less expereinced with technology, and make the site more digestible for individuals curious about thier findings. As the site deals with state guidelines, the public should be able to easily navigate the site and deduce the main points of their research.

To begin, I will analyze the design of the SCCWRP's website, along with a similar organizaiton that connects research with companies on a larger scale - Ocean Visions - according to Nielson's 10 Heuristics for system usability.
