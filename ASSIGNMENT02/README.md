## Redesigning the SCCWRP's Website

#### by Lindsay Harrison in Digital Humanities 110 at UCLA

### Introduction

The Southern California Coastal Water Research Project (SCCWRP) researches Southern California’s marine waters and guides the state in setting standards for water sanitation. Their website serves numerous functions, including providing contact information, the schedule of their public meetings, a portal to their research publications, and the links to numerous datasets integral to their research. Primarily, the website provides information and informational resources to its users.

As concluded from a Heuristic evaluation of the SCCWRP’s website, numerous aspects of the website could be improved upon - especially in regards to the site’s search functionality and organization. The website’s most integral issues include: the awkward publication search functionality, the lack of organization in the navigation bar, the lack of organization in the datasets portal, and the general difficulty in discerning important text and action items within the website. To explore how these perceived issues manifest during a user’s interaction with the website, a usability test was conducted. Usability tests determine how an interface aids or hinders a user in completing certain tasks. This type of test is typically conducted with a group of potential users at an appropriate lab setting, or remotely using an e-meeting software. Moderators prompt users to complete routine tasks while the session is recorded. The sessions are then later analyzed to discover how the website may be improved.

### Methodology

The present study is the pilot test in order to test the setting and various study materials. The user will be recorded remotely in a Zoom meeting hosted in the United States that takes approximately 30 minutes. Both the participant and the moderator will use their own personal computers, and the cameras and microphones of these computers will feed audio and visual data into the recorded meeting room. The user will walk through four tasks relevant to the SCCWRP’s functionality, using the live website in the process. As they complete the tasks, they will fill in a Google Form containing follow-up questions regarding the completion of the tasks. Space to write additional comments is integrated throughout the survey. Qualitative data will be taken as participant responses to questions about each task, which will later be organized in a spreadsheet. Participant ratings of the difficulty of each task will be recorded as quantitative data, along with how many tasks each participant can complete.

The usability test will consist of the following sections:

**Background Questions:** This questionnaire serves to gain information on the user’s experience and past usage of the website to allow us to better understand where they are coming from.

**Pre-test Questions:** This questionnaire serves to gather the user’s initial reactions to the website’s main user interface, the homepage. Questions ask the user about how trustworthy along with how difficult the website looks.

**Tasks:** The user will walk through several tasks, each of which consists of common actions a user of the site might take within the website. Each task along with the heuristic(s) it measures is described below.

**Post-test Questions:** This questionnaire prompts the  user to reflect on how difficult they thought the tasks were to complete, how likely they would take certain steps within a task using the website, and how long they perceived each task to take. It serves to summarize their experience working through the tasks.

**System Usability Scale:** This survey attempts to determine how usable an interface is by prompting the user to select a response from “Strongly Disagree” to “Strongly Agree” for each of ten statements.

**Production Satisfaction Card Selection:** This survey attempts to qualify the interface according to the user’s perception by asking them to select 5 adjectives that they feel best describe the product from a grid of numerous words.
