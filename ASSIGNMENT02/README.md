## Redesigning the SCCWRP's Website

#### by Lindsay Harrison in Digital Humanities 110 at UCLA

### Introduction

The Southern California Coastal Water Research Project (SCCWRP) researches Southern California’s marine waters and guides the state in setting standards for water sanitation. Their website serves numerous functions, including providing contact information, the schedule of their public meetings, a portal to their research publications, and the links to numerous datasets integral to their research. Primarily, the website provides information and informational resources to its users.

As concluded from a Heuristic evaluation of the SCCWRP’s website, numerous aspects of the website could be improved upon - especially in regards to the site’s search functionality and organization. The website’s most integral issues include: the awkward publication search functionality, the lack of organization in the navigation bar, the lack of organization in the datasets portal, and the general difficulty in discerning important text and action items within the website. To explore how these perceived issues manifest during a user’s interaction with the website, a usability test was conducted. Usability tests determine how an interface aids or hinders a user in completing certain tasks. This type of test is typically conducted with a group of potential users at an appropriate lab setting, or remotely using an e-meeting software. Moderators prompt users to complete routine tasks while the session is recorded. The sessions are then later analyzed to discover how the website may be improved.

### Methodology

The present study is the pilot test in order to test the setting and various study materials. The user will be recorded remotely in a Zoom meeting hosted in the United States that takes approximately 30 minutes. Both the participant and the moderator will use their own personal computers, and the cameras and microphones of these computers will feed audio and visual data into the recorded meeting room. The user will walk through four tasks relevant to the SCCWRP’s functionality, using the live website in the process. As they complete the tasks, they will fill in a Google Form containing follow-up questions regarding the completion of the tasks. Space to write additional comments is integrated throughout the survey. Qualitative data will be taken as participant responses to questions about each task, which will later be organized in a spreadsheet. Participant ratings of the difficulty of each task will be recorded as quantitative data, along with how many tasks each participant can complete.

The usability test will consist of the following sections:

**Background Questions:** This questionnaire serves to gain information on the user’s experience and past usage of the website to allow us to better understand where they are coming from.

**Pre-test Questions:** This questionnaire serves to gather the user’s initial reactions to the website’s main user interface, the homepage. Questions ask the user about how trustworthy along with how difficult the website looks.

**Tasks:** The user will walk through several tasks, each of which consists of common actions a user of the site might take within the website. Each task along with the heuristic(s) it measures is described below.

**Post-test Questions:** This questionnaire prompts the  user to reflect on how difficult they thought the tasks were to complete, how likely they would take certain steps within a task using the website, and how long they perceived each task to take. It serves to summarize their experience working through the tasks.

**System Usability Scale:** This survey attempts to determine how usable an interface is by prompting the user to select a response from “Strongly Disagree” to “Strongly Agree” for each of ten statements.

**Production Satisfaction Card Selection:** This survey attempts to qualify the interface according to the user’s perception by asking them to select 5 adjectives that they feel best describe the product from a grid of numerous words.

**Post-test Poll:** The user will answer some basic demographic information, so that the researchers may better describe the participant group.





### The Tasks

In the current usability study, the following heuristics will be tested: **(3) user control and freedom, (4) consistency and standards, (5) error prevention, and (6) recognition rather than recall**. Heuristics 3 and 4 were chosen for testing since they were ranked the most severe, and heuristics 5 and 6 were additionally chosen since they also have somewhat high severity ratings. Moreover, heuristic 5 is crucial to the basic functionality and efficiency of a website, and heuristic 6 is important when the website contains extensive information along with performable actions as the SCCWRP’s website does.


##### Task 1

The user will be asked to use the site’s publication search functionality. This will mainly serve to test **(3) user control and freedom** since it will involve the user moving through several of the site’s states. The task will also test **(5) error prevention**, since a condition exists in the search functionality that produces an error message.

##### Task 2

The user will search for information regarding the association’s public meetings. This will mainly serve to test **(4) consistency and standards** as the task will involve the user navigating through multiple similar pages. The task additionally tests for **(6) recognition rather than recall** since it will test the visibility of certain navigational and other links as the user attempts to find them.

##### Task 3

The user will be asked to identify a specific dataset that would aid them as a specific type of researcher. This task will mainly test **(3) user control and freedom** since, like the first task, it involves navigating through different states. Unlike the first task, this task will also involve site navigation to a greater extent. The task also tests **(5) error prevention** as there are several error-prone conditions within the task.

##### Task 4

The task will ask the user to identify specific contact information for a particular member of the SCCWRP’s staff. The task will test for **(4) consistency and standards** since it will take the user to several new pages and allow us to observe if the user responds similarly to the staff page’s action items compared to other pages.

### Reflection

The pilot test gave me several takeaways both with regard to the design of the test itself and learning how to moderate. As a moderator, I learned that a participant’s reaction to a website can be different than their overall perception of it. For instance, the pilot test participant expressed frustration with several tasks, but when asked about the site’s overall usability, they reported it was easy to use. Additionally, I learned that it can be challenging to prompt a user to narrate their thoughts without asking them any leading questions. At several points, I wanted to know why or why not the participant clicked a particular button without making them think they did something wrong (or right). I think during the tasks themselves I asked more follow-up questions than necessary and even asked a few leading questions. Next time, I should practice observing participant behavior first and foremost.

As for the UT design, I believe the form questions encouraged the participant to give useful, detailed feedback. Additionally, the participant appeared to understand the tasks well along with what each step asked them to do. However, the participant did have some questions on a few of the post-test surveys, so in the future, I think I would prepare more detailed, clearer instructions to give. Furthermore, I had not set a standard number of minutes to allot for each task, so I was unsure when to mark a task as incomplete and move on. For later tests, I will determine an appropriate amount of time to spend on each task, and if the user exceeds the time limit, we will move on. Finally, while the participant did understand the task steps well, I think several steps directed the user on how to navigate the website more than they should have (especially Task 1), so I will rewrite these steps to read more generically.
