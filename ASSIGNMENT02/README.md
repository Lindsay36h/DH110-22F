# DH110 - Assignment02 - Usability Testing
## Redesigning the SCCWRP's Website

#### by Lindsay Harrison in Digital Humanities 110 at UCLA

### Introduction

The Southern California Coastal Water Research Project (SCCWRP) researches Southern California’s marine waters and guides the state in setting standards for water sanitation. Their website serves numerous functions, including providing contact information, the schedule of their public meetings, a portal to their research publications, and the links to numerous datasets integral to their research. Primarily, the website provides information and informational resources to its users.

As concluded from a Heuristic evaluation of the SCCWRP’s website, numerous aspects of the website could be improved upon - especially in regards to the site’s search functionality and organization. The website’s most integral issues include: the awkward publication search functionality, the lack of organization in the navigation bar, the lack of organization in the datasets portal, and the general difficulty in discerning important text and action items within the website. To explore how these perceived issues manifest during a user’s interaction with the website, a usability test was conducted. Usability tests determine how an interface aids or hinders a user in completing certain tasks. This type of test is typically conducted with a group of potential users at an appropriate lab setting, or remotely using an e-meeting software. Moderators prompt users to complete routine tasks while the session is recorded. The sessions are then later analyzed to discover how the website may be improved.
