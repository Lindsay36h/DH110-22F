## Introduction

The Southern California Coastal Water Research Project (SCCWRP) conducts research to aid in Southern California’s ecosystem management. As one of their website’s main purposes is to help others find this research and learn from their findings, my redesign of the SCCWRP website will mainly focus on helping users to find environmental research articles as well as information relevant to environmental research. The cognitive need to find information is central to this activity, so the website should be well-organized and have an efficient search system for finding relevant research. Currently, the site’s navigation is not effectively organized, and the search functionality is awkward.

### Target Users

To most effectively redesign the website, I must consider its target audience. These users consist of adults between the ages of 25 and 35, interested in environmental sustainability and research. The average user likely has some knowledge of environmental research, so the audience is not mainstream although it may not consist solely of experts - the audience will consist of people investigating research from different experience levels. These users would be looking for available research for their own purposes, likely for a project with a university, organization, or company. Users may also be employed by the SCCWRP or an agency under it and are looking for research to reference for an upcoming project. To complete their search for research articles, they would search the SCCWRP’s publications database using filters. They would also navigate through the website’s links to outside databases. Their search would likely be occurring wherever they consider to be a workplace: their office, a public work space, or their home.

### Research Goals

**Better understand the main user motivations and goals related to searching for environmental research.**

**Determine what website features facilitate the search for relevant research publications.**

**Determine what website features hinder the search for relevant research publications.**

**Identify what specific article/report information is important to users when searching for relevant research.**


## Research Methods

To conduct user research for the SCCWRP’s website, I will interview an individual representative of the target user group. This target user group features employed adults, between the ages of 25 and 35, who are interested in environmental sustainability research. The interview will consist of three main parts: background questions on the user’s history and relationship with finding environmental research, observing the user walk through three activities relevant to doing environmental research, and finally a set of questions regarding the frustrations and/or satisfaction they feel when doing these processes.

### Requirements & Constraints

The interview will be conducted over a remote zoom session lasting less than an hour. The camera and microphone on the user’s personal computer will collect relevant video data, which will be streamed within a recorded zoom meeting. The interview will require the user to have a computer capable of this. Furthermore, the research will require that the user has an interest with or experience with environmental research. However, the user does not necessarily need to have experience with water quality research, which may pose a constraint to the study since I will learn less about how experienced users work when finding water research. Another possible constraint may be the participant’s motivation and time constraints. To counter these, I will try to be respectful of the participant’s time and keep the meeting under an hour.
